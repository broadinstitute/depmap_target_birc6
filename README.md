Targeting of mutated oncogenes has led to the identification of new targeted therapies.
However, druggable oncogene mutations do not occur in most cancers. Systematic
identification of signaling pathways required for the fitness of cancer cells will facilitate the
development of new cancer therapies. We used gene essentiality measurements in 1,086
cancer cell lines to identify selective co-essentiality modules and found that a ubiquitin ligase
complex composed of UBA6, BIRC6, KCMF1 and UBR4, which encode an E1, E2 and two
heterodimeric E3 subunits, respectively, is required for the survival of a subset of epithelial
tumors that exhibit a high degree of aneuploidy. Suppressing BIRC6 in cell lines that are
dependent on this complex led to a substantial reduction in cell fitness in vitro and potent tumor
regression in vivo. Mechanistically, BIRC6 suppression resulted in selective activation of the
integrated stress response (ISR) by stabilization and upregulation of the heme-regulated
inhibitor (HRI), a direct ubiquitination target of the UBA6/BIRC6/KCMF1/UBR4 complex. These
observations uncover a novel ubiquitination cascade that regulates ISR and highlight the
potential of ISR activation as a new therapeutic strategy.
